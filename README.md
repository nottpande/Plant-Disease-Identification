<h1> Plant Disease Identification (ML project) </h1>
        <p><h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2><br
          <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a CNN model for accurate identification of diseases in potato, tomato, and pepper plants. Create a FastAPI for seamless integration with external applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Utilized Kaggle dataset with labeled plant images.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Accuracy:</strong> Achieves approximately 92% accuracy using CNN.</li>
        <li><strong>API Development:</strong> Implemented FastAPI to expose model functionality via endpoints for image-based disease predictions.</li></p>
